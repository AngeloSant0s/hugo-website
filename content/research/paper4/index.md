##### Description

 Using a REDD + project financed by USAID in Eastern Zambia, I investigate how community compensations due conservation impact enviromental outcomes, specifically deforestation, fire occurence, and emissions. Leveraging the household and village surveys, I aim to investigate how forest dependence and social normals can impact the community performance on conservation.
